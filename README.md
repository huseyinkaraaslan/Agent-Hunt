# Agent-Hunt

### Aim System
Aiming system I developed using Animation Rigging

### Sniper Enemy
The sniper enemy feature I added to the game scans between two specified points by controlling the current point movement with MoveTowards. 
<br/><br/>If the laser touches the player during the scan, the laser waits for 2 seconds at the point of contact with the player's body and goes into alarm (All enemies).
<br/><br/>When the alarm is raised, no matter where the laser is (even if another enemy sees the player and the laser is far away), we slowly aim the laser at the player's head.
I added vibration to the laser to make it more realistic when the sniper enemy aims the laser at the player's head and holds it steady.
